(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n         * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n         * better normalize spin speed.
